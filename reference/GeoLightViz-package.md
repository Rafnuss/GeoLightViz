# GeoLightViz: Interactive Visualization Tool for Light-Level Geolocator Analysis

Provides an interactive Shiny application for exploring and
understanding light-level geolocator data analysis. The app features a
unique side-by-side visualization that shows how twilight events
(sunrise/sunset times) translate to geographic positions on a map in
real-time. Users can interactively label twilight data, define
stationary periods, test position hypotheses by clicking on the map, and
explore calibration effects and likelihood surfaces. Designed to make
the complex twilight geolocation method more transparent and intuitive,
helping researchers understand data quality, position uncertainty, and
the role of calibration in improving estimates.
